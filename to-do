To-do list:
- export two-panel age-dependent figure (laydate, egg volume)
- export three-panel sesonal-dependent figure (polyandry, laydate distribution, egg volume) 
- "mega" table and forest plot of all model results:
  - Three columns: Polyandry, Egg Volume, Laydate
  - Three chunks of rows: Fixed effect estimates (with 95% CI), Random effect estimates (with 95% CI), Repeatabilities (with 95% CI), Sample sizes
- tidy explore scripts
